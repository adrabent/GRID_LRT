Updates 15-03-2016
1) removed old HBAdefault strategy and replaced by new version suitable for LOFAR v2_15,
  this was done by simply overwriting the old file i.e:

  cp HBAdefault-aoflagger-2.7.1.rfis HBAdefault.rfis
  cp LBAdefault-aoflagger-2.7.1.rfis LBAdefault.rfis

  * please note that it is not yet possible to use the LBA strategy without either:
    - manually overwriting HBAdefault by LBAdefault
    - or by changing the code in avg_dmx_v2.py
    - or by adding an LBA flag in the whoel strategy and updating the .sh and .py

2) added 16 GB memory limitation for AOflagger to avg_dmx_v2.py



Notes:
- the demixing model is set to Ateam_LBA.sky.tar, this is the low-resolution model.
